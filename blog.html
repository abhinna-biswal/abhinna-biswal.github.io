									<h3 class="major">Top 5 Blogs of Web Development</h3>
									<p>
										As you learn the fundamentals of web development and look to enhance 
										your knowledge, it’s important to scour the internet to see what other
										people are doing and saying. While it’s great to stay up-to-date on 
										trends through magazines and books, web development blogs provide you 
										with an abundance of fresh, free content. Blogs have become increasingly 
										more popular over the years and even though sports and fashion blogs led 
										the charge at first, it’s now very likely that every topic out there has 
										at least one blog dedicated to it.<br>
										
										Web development blogs can be extremely helpful when looking to expand 
										your knowledge in a particular web development niche. However, when 
										searching it’s easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of content that 
										is out there. How do you distinguish between good content and bad content? 
										Because of this difficulty, we decided to compile some of our favorite blogs 
										and urge you to take a look: 
									</p>
									<p>If you’re a beginner…<br>
										<h3>Developer Drive</h3><br>
										As mentioned above, this is a perfect option if you’re just beginning 
										your career in web development. By web developers, for web developers, 
										Developer Drive offers the latest news in the world of web development. 
										This includes opinion articles, tutorials, tips & tricks to start off on 
										the right foot. Are you looking to learn how to minimize downtime? 
										How about ensuring your site is secure and easy for consumers to navigate? 
										Or would you like to keep tabs on every Microsoft software release? From 
										JavaScript to mobile development, Developer Drive has you covered.
									</p>

									<h3>Simple Programmer</h3>
									<p>
										While Simple Programmer was originally created by founder John Sonmez 
										to distill what he learned as a web developer into understandable 
										content, today it is focused on helping software developers, 
										programmers and other IT professionals improve their careers and 
										their lives.  This blog gets into the nitty-gritty of being a web 
										developer and if you’ve wondered about something web development 
										related, there’s a good chance they’ve written about it. 
										Simple Programmer puts a fun spin on videos, keeping you engaged 
										with humor while providing valuable content. They’re constantly 
										posting new articles – almost daily – so you’ll never be bored.
									</p>

									<h3>CodeNewbie</h3>
									<p>
										Just like the blog title says – if you’re a code newbie looking for 
										insight on all things web development, you’re in the right place. 
										This site acts as a virtual community for anyone new to the coding 
										world. CodeNewbie offers an open look into the lives of web developers 
										and serves as a place for people to read about career advice while 
										hearing stories from people on their coding journey through the site’s 
										podcasts.  
									</p>

									<h3> Scotch.io</h3>
									<p> 
										So, you’ve been a web developer for a while, or maybe you’re just a 
										fast learner. Either way, hats off to you! Some of the ‘beginner’ 
										blogs outlined above may be a bit too junior for you, which is where 
										Scotch.io comes in handy. This blog is full of tutorials on everything 
										from JavaScript to PHP. They also offer some interesting courses that 
										require minimal commitment and can help take your coding expertise to 
										the next level.
